<span id="popinstall"></span><h1>PopOS Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#popos-installation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>This section describes a process that can be used to install PopOS
on a computer system that uses a UEFI based hard drive, which is the most
comman type sold in standard Windows and Linux computers.  In addition,
these instructions assume that the reader has access to a working computer
to download some necessary files.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This instructions in this section were crafted for a Dell XPS computer
that came pre-installed with Ubuntu Linux.  Their may be some extra steps not
described in this document for someone using a computer that was pre-installed
with windows.  These steps will occur in the beginning of the process to
prepare the computer when in Bios mode prior to installation.  The reader
of this document should investigate these steps prior to beginning the process
as outlined in this document.</p>
<section id="pre-installation-activities">
<h2>Pre-Installation Activities<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-installation-activities" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Before we start the Arch Linux installation
we need to download an Arch Linux iso file and flash the distribution to a
thumb drive.</p>
<section id="download-an-iso-file">
<h3>Download an ISO file.<a class="headerlink" href="#download-an-iso-file" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Navigate to the <a class="reference external" href="https://system76.com/pop/download/">PopOS</a> directory
where you can see download options for different computer configurations.
As of hte date this document was written there are three options for Intel,
AMD chips with older NVIDIA grpahics cards, one for Intel, AMD chips with newer
NVIDIA graphics cards, and one for Raspberry Pi boards.  Determine which
option is applicable to you and click download.</p>
</section>
<section id="flash-the-distribution-to-a-thumb-drive">
<h3>Flash the Distribution to a Thumb Drive<a class="headerlink" href="#flash-the-distribution-to-a-thumb-drive" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Once the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iso</span></code> file has been saved to a thumb drive we need to flash the
distribution to the drive so we can use it as a bootable drive for the
installation process. There are several utility programs that can be used
to transform a thumb drive into a bootable drive, but I prefer to use
<a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/bztsrc/usbimager">USB Imager</a>.  The following image
shows an example of the download options in these
<a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/bztsrc/usbimager">USB Imager</a></p>
<img alt="USB Imager download options" src="_images/usb_imager.png" />
<p>Pick the option that is best suited to the computer you are using to the operating
system you are using to download and flash the thumb drive.  Once you click
on an option it should download an installer.  Once you have installed USB Imager
you should have access to a GUI that looks like the image below.</p>
<img alt="The USB Imager Graphical user Interface" src="_images/imager.png" />
<p>It is usually best to leave the .iso file in the <cite>Downloads</cite> directory where it
was placed when you retrieved it from the <a class="reference external" href="https://system76.com/pop/download/">PopOS Store</a>
Next click on the three dots in the upper right icon to search for your thumb drive in
the filesystem.  Ensure that the verify button is checked, then click on
the Write icon.  This will start the process of flashing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.iso</span></code> to the
flash drive.  The entire process may take a few minutes to complete.  Once the
process is complete, your thumb drive should be relabelled automatically to
reflect the version of PopOS that was flashed to it.</p>
</section>
<section id="arch-linux-linux-installation">
<h3>Arch Linux Linux Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#arch-linux-linux-installation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Now that the thumb drive has been flashed with the PopOS <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.iso</span></code> file,
we are prepared to use it as a mechanism to install PopOS Linux on your computer.
Ensure that the computer is powered off, and insert the thumb drive into its interface
with the computer.  Also, if possible try to complete this process with a hard
link internet connection in case their are issues with wireless during the
install process.</p>
<p>Boot your computer into the Bios mode by turning the computer
on and then repetatively depressing the F12 key.  Once booted into Bios mode you
should see an option for different boot menus, to include a boot option for
your USB drive.  Click on this option, and it will boot from the flash drive.
This boot option is commonly known as bpooting into live mode.  Once booted
you should see several options, which may change from version to version;
however; you should see an option for the following or something very similar.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>PopOS<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>medium<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">(</span>x86_64,<span class="w"> </span>UEFI<span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Use the up or down arrow keys to navigate to this option if you are not
already hovering on this option.  Click enter, and this will enter into
the Arch Linux installation process.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The instructions listed above may not work for a computer that
has a Bios tailored for windows.  There may be some bios options that you will
have to manually change, but these are beyond the scope of this document.</p>
<p>From this point on, the PopOS installer will guide you through the process.
I highly recomment clicking <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">yes</span></code> to the option for encrypting the hard drive.</p>
