PopOS Configuration for Jon Webb!
=================================
My name is Jon Webb and I am an engineer and scientist that specializes
in Aerospace Engineering, Nuclear Engineering and Computer Science. While
at the office I use whatever computer system my employer requires; however,
at home I prefer to use a computer system with a PopOS
Operating System (OS).  PopOS/Cosmic is a fairly easy Linux OS to install;
however, their are many nuances to installing modern software with its 
package manager `apt`.  As a result I am writing this documentation to describe the step
by step process for installing PopOS as well as othe programs that are useful
to someone interested in starting a career in Engineering, Data Science,
and Computer Science.

**NOTE:** This installation process is crafted for someone using a UEFI
encrypted hard drive.  While this document describes the process for 
installing Arch Linux, it also has several instructions that are useful
for someone using another Linux distrubition or a Macintosh computer system

Installation
============
This package can be downloaded with the following command. **NOTE:** You will 
not need to clone this repository until you get to the ``Post Pop Install``
section of the installation process.
